SiamVGG: Visual Tracking with Deeper Siamese Networks

Won 4th place in [VOT2018 Realtime Challenge](http://www.votchallenge.net/vot2018/)

We will soon release our training code and testing code.

The VOT2018 submision file is available. Feel free to try it! Download the pretrained data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13rx9kMJ1lwpics1Qr9_uKjloqLHfMaoU/view?usp=sharing) and follow the instruction to set up the test. (Partial of the code are modified from [SiamFC-pytorch](https://github.com/huanglianghua/siamfc-pytorch), thanks to Lianghua!)

 ðŸ”´Currently, I'm trying to combine the RPN module into it. After that, I'll release the training part and the SiamVGGRPN code.
